SecondScreen is a web app for following along with hackathon demos.

It was created at @hackprinceton Fall 2013, where it mostly worked.

It is currently very hacky. Remaining work:
work until done:
x ui to give background on about current hacks
x user login
x buttons to do things around current hacks (like/dislike/audience choice/i'd use)
x "the pretty" (raymond)
x like button/twitter accordingly
x harden subscriptions

x set up deployment
x only Alexey can change current team.
- (but folks can override)
- livestream if it works
- (what if unknown team - should still work
- youtube (first screen idea)
- prediction/charts
- google analytics
